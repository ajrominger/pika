# `pika`

*An R package for macroecology*

This is the companion package for the ["happy SAD"](https://github.com/ajrominger/happySAD) project.  Here I implement the best practices I develop and test there.  This will also eventually be the backend for pacakge [`meteR`](https://github.com/cmerow/meteR).
